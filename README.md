Problem Statement

Design of network security projects using honeypots

Honeypots are closely monitored decoys that are employed in a network to study the trail of hackers and to alert network administrators of a possible intrusion.

Using honeypots provides a cost-effective solution to increase the security posture of an organization.
 Even though it is not a panacea for security breaches, it is useful as a tool for network forensics and intrusion detection.
Nowadays, they are also being extensively used by the research community to study issues in network security, such as Internet worms, spam control, DoS attacks, etc.


#Honeypots Made Easy By Using Canarytokens by Thinkst

Uses the [Canarytokens](https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens) Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on your network.

#For Local Production and Tunneling we are using [Pagekite](https://pagekite.net/home/)
PageKite is a reverse proxy tool that connects local servers to the public Internet.

It gives proper domain names to servers running on localhost and makes them visible to the world, bypassing NAT and firewalls. PageKite works today on any computer with a modern Python (2.x) interpreter (pagekite.py) and a C-language version (libpagekite) for embedded devices is under development.
